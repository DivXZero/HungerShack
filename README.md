# HungerShack Development

## :whale: Install Docker
Follow the instructions for
[Docker Engine Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## :sparkles: Create Aliases
Place in the appropriate .bashrc, .zshrc, etc. file
```bash
alias dup='docker-compose up'
alias ddown='docker-compose down'
alias drun='docker-compose run'
alias dbuild='docker-compose build'
alias drst='rm tmp/pids/server.pid'
```

## :octocat: Clone & Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DivXZero/HungerShack.git
cd HungerShack
dbuild
```

Once the docker container has been built, create the database(s):
```bash
drun web rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## :rocket: Launch the Docker container(s)
```bash
dup
```

## :metal: Up & running
You should now have the Hunger Shack project running at http://localhost:3000/
The original terminal session can be used to monitor the rails server, the second may be used to execute commands. The server can be stopped at any time using ctrl-c, you may also close the terminal and the container will continue to run.

### Warnings / Cleanup

* If you stop the rails server with ctrl-c, there is a good chance you will receive a warning that the server is already running if you attempt to bring the container back up. This can be resolved by deleting the file 'tmp/pids/server.pid', or using the alias command ```drst```
